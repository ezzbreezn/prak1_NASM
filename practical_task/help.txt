INTEGRAL CALCULATION APPLICATION
The program calculates the area bounded by functions (by default):
-- e^x + 2
-- -1/x
-- -(2 + x)/3
                                                                          
The tangent method (Newton's method) is used to 
find the intersection points, and the quadrature formula 
of rectangles is used to calculate te according 
definite integral
                                                         
MAIN OPTIONS:
                                         
-help -- shows the list of available options of the program 
                                                  
-isect -- prints abscises of intersection points of graphs of 
corresponding functions obtained as a result of approximate 
tangent calculation by the root() function 
                                           
-iter -- prints the number of iterations of the intersection
points search method performing by the root() function

-debug -- starts debugging mode and prints intermediate values 
of intersection points and integrals
                                        
-test root/integral <according operands> -- starts testing 
the root() and integral() functions for the
specified functions from the list of available ones 
(you can see it using the -funclist option)
OPERANDS:
    MODE SPECIFIERS:
    1) root -- testing of intersection points calculation function root()
    Arguments:
      -test root f g a b eps
	f - number of the first function from the funclist
	g - number of the second function from the funclist
	a - left border of the point localization segment
	b - right border of the point localization segment
	eps - calculation error
    2) integral -- testing of definite integral calculation function integral()
    Arguments:
      -test integral f a b eps
	f - number of the function from the funclist
	a - left border of the integration segment
	b - right border of the integration segment
	eps - calculation error

Testing can also be performed with the flags -isect, -iter, -debug that were listed above          
                      
-funclist -- displays a list of functions that are
available for testing functions for calculating
intersection points (root()) and a definite integral (integral())
