FUNCLIST
The following set of functions is provided for testing 
the root() and integral() functions
These functions are selected for clarity in such a way that 
the graphs of each of them intersect with each other 
on the segment [-2, 2], and the area under their graphs, i.e. the value
of the corresponding definite integral, is positive on the same segment.

To specify a function as a test parameter, type its number as an argument.

1) f1 = -x^2 + 4

2) f2 = exp(x)

3) f3 = x + 1

4) f4 = sqrt(x + 3)

5) f5 = x^3

6) f6 = sqrt(5 - x)

7) f7 = x^2 / 2 + 3x

To test chosen function, run the program with the next flags:

 - To calculate the intersection point:
   ./program -test root <func1№> <func2№> <lborder> <rborder> <eps> <optional flags>

 - To calculate the definite integral:
   ./program -test integral <func№> <lborder> <eps> <rborder>
